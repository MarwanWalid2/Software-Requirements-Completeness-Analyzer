    "domain_model": "The consensus domain model integrates key classes from all three source models by merging overlapping subsystems and refining attributes, methods, and relationships. The Facility class combines structural, operational, and environmental attributes from all models. Water and HVAC systems are unified to include purification, recycling, and climate control functionalities. Storage systems are abstracted into a generic StorageSystem with specialized subclasses (FoodStorage, EquipmentStorage, IceCoreStorage) to capture diverse storage requirements. Communication and control components are enhanced by incorporating elements from diverse models, and additional subsystems (MonitoringSystem, SecuritySystem, FireSuppressionSystem, MedicalEquipment, CommonArea, KitchenEquipment, FuelStorage) are included to present a complete facility view. Conflicts were resolved by choosing the most detailed and representative attributes and methods from each model, resulting in a coherent, comprehensive domain model.",
    "analysis": "This consensus analysis was created by merging the findings from multiple requirement analyses. For requirement issues, duplicate and similar observations were combined while preserving unique insights such as ambiguous terminology, missing compliance information, and inconsistencies between the requirements and the domain model. Missing requirements were consolidated from the source analyses, ensuring that critical aspects\u2014such as structural integrity monitoring, security authentication, data backup, emergency procedures, and testing protocols\u2014are captured. Domain model issues were aggregated to highlight missing or incomplete components (e.g., Camera, Crew, Radio attributes, MotionSensor, and others) necessary for aligning the domain model with the stated requirements. This comprehensive overview highlights the most important areas needing attention and guides subsequent refinements."
