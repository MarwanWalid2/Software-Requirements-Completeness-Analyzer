    "domain_model": "I merged the three models by identifying all unique classes, attributes, and methods, and combining overlapping elements. I preserved critical system operations from Model 1, enriched functionality (monitoring, notifications, user input, reporting) from Model 2, and added user, playlist, and track entities from Model 3. I resolved conflicts by unifying similar classes (e.g., Detector as a base for RadonDetector and MotionDetector) and ensured consistent descriptions and multiplicities. The final model provides a coherent, complete view of the smart home domain.",
    "analysis": "Analysis aggregated using openai with specialized component processing:\n- requirement_completeness: Aggregated analyses from OpenAI, Claude, and Deepseek. For each requirement, the lowest completeness score was chosen to maintain a conservative assessment. Missing elements lists were merged to capture the union of all identified gaps. Suggested improvements and rationales from each source were preserved and consolidated, ensuring all unique insights are included for enhanced clarity, traceability, and testability.\n- requirement_issues: Merged duplicate ambiguity and testability issues by combining descriptions and fixes with the highest severity. Preserved unique conflicts, inconsistencies, implementation, and missing-context issues from both sources. Standardized phrasing and aggregated affected elements to produce a coherent, non-redundant list.\n- missing_requirements: After comparing the three LLM analyses, all 25 missing requirements (MR1 through MR25) were consistent across sources. I consolidated them into a single comprehensive list, preserving each unique requirement and using the most detailed suggested_requirement and rationale provided.\n- domain_model_issues: We merged duplicate entries for the System class into a single Inconsistent issue with combined descriptions, suggested fixes, and the union of affected requirements. We integrated the RFIDTag details from Claude into the pet management group from OpenAI, preserving the missing classes PetFeeder, RFIDTag, LitterBox, OdorSensor, and VaccinationRecord. We included all unique missing elements from both sources (Button, Threshold/NotificationRule, SoilMoistureDetector, UI subsystems, Notification, Report, SmokeDetector & CarbonMonoxideDetector, Schedule, BiometricAuthentication, the System.configurationSettings attribute, and the System-Notification relationship). Issue types were mapped to Missing, Incomplete, or Inconsistent and severities were set to the highest level indicated. Each entry provides a clear description, suggested fix, and aggregated impacted requirements."
