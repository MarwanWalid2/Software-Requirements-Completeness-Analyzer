    "domain_model": "I consolidated the three source models by unifying duplicate classes (e.g., merging Pump, PumpMotor into SubmersiblePump) and harmonizing methods (splitting monitor/report into distinct operations). Sensor, switch, display, and alarm classes were standardized across models. I chose composition for owned components (e.g., control system contains pumps, switches, sensors, display, and alarm) and associations for operational relationships (e.g., pump control unit manages pumps and uses level switches, float switch associates with pumps). Where methods or attributes differed, I selected the more detailed or flexible variant (e.g., separate record/display methods, threshold attributes in FloatSwitch). The resulting model provides a complete, conflict-free view with PlantUML specifications reflecting the final structure.",
    "analysis": "Analysis aggregated using openai with specialized component processing:\n- requirement_completeness: For each requirement, I consolidated the completeness scores from the three analyses, taking the most conservative (lowest) score when any differences existed (though in this case the scores aligned). I combined all missing elements into a union to ensure no deficiency is overlooked. I unified the suggested improvements, drawing the most detailed version (including priority, version, status, source, acceptance criteria, dependencies, and performance metrics) to cover all identified gaps. Rationales were preserved and adapted to explain why each requirement remains incomplete and how the suggested details resolve ambiguities and enhance testability, traceability, and clarity.\n- requirement_issues: Aggregated issues from all sources, mapped original issue types to a unified set (Ambiguity\u2192Incomplete, Missing Context/Testability/Implementation\u2192Missing, Conflict\u2192Conflict, Inconsistency\u2192Inconsistency), selected the highest severity when duplicates existed, merged similar descriptions and fixes into consolidated issues, and preserved unique concerns while resolving overlaps and conflicts.\n- missing_requirements: All three source analyses provided the same set of 17 missing requirements (MR1 through MR17). I consolidated them into a single list, preserving each unique ID and selecting the most detailed description, suggested requirement text, affected model elements, and rationale from the sources.\n- domain_model_issues: We consolidated duplicate issues across sources by grouping on element and issue type, merged overlapping entries to include the most detailed descriptions and suggested fixes, aggregated all relevant requirement references, and promoted severity levels when at least one source indicated MUST FIX. Class-level attribute and method omissions were combined into unified entries per class. Relationship inconsistencies and missing associations were preserved as distinct issues. Novel suggestions like DataLogger, IndicatorLight, Buzzer, and MoistureSensor associations were included. This approach ensures all unique problems from the three analyses are represented with clear fixes and complete requirement coverage."
